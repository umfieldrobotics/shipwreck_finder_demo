A demonstration of a shipwrecks finder model from bathymmetry data, presented at the [AI4Shipwrecks: Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for Shipwreck Detection](https://greatlakes25.oceansconference.org/experience/tutorials/) for our work _ShipwreckFinder: A QGIS Tool for Shipwreck
Detection in Multibeam Sonar Data_ (Paper Oceans-2025), by [Onur Bagoren](https://www.obagoren.com/), [Anja Sheppard](https://anja-sheppard.github.io/), [David Smith](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-smith-661b22281) and [Katherine Skinner](https://robotics.umich.edu/profile/katherine-skinner/).
